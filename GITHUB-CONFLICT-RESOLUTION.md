# GitHub PR Conflict Resolution

## Issue
GitHub is reporting conflicts in `.github/workflows/basic-validation.yml` that don't appear in local git operations.

## Analysis
- Local git operations show no conflicts
- File syntax is valid YAML
- File doesn't exist in master branch (should be a simple addition)
- All merge operations locally are successful

## Potential Causes
1. **GitHub merge algorithm differences**: GitHub may use a different merge strategy than local git
2. **Base branch differences**: GitHub might be using a different merge base
3. **File encoding issues**: Potential line ending or encoding differences
4. **Timing issues**: Race conditions between branch updates and PR processing

## Resolution Strategy
This commit explicitly addresses the GitHub conflict by:
1. Documenting the issue and resolution approach
2. Ensuring the workflow file is properly formatted
3. Creating a clear commit message explaining the resolution
4. Providing context for the repository separation implementation

## File Status
- ✅ Valid YAML syntax
- ✅ Proper workflow structure
- ✅ Aligned with repository separation goals
- ✅ No local conflicts detected

## Next Steps
If GitHub continues to report conflicts, the issue may be:
1. A GitHub platform issue that resolves automatically
2. A need to recreate the PR with a fresh branch
3. A requirement for manual merge resolution in the GitHub interface

The workflow file is correct and ready for the repository separation implementation.
