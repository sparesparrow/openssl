OpenSSL CI/CD Modernization Migration Guide
===========================================

Executive Summary
-----------------

This guide outlines the step-by-step migration from the current OpenSSL CI/CD system to a modern, Conan-based approach. The migration is designed to be gradual, low-risk, and maintain backward compatibility throughout the process.

Current State vs. Target State
------------------------------

### Current State Challenges
- **Build Time**: Average 45-60 minutes per full CI run

- **Resource Usage**: 20+ parallel jobs consuming significant compute resources

- **Maintenance Overhead**: Platform-specific configurations requiring manual maintenance

- **Dependency Issues**: System package manager dependencies causing version conflicts

- **Limited Caching**: Minimal build artifact reuse across jobs

- **Security Gaps**: No dependency vulnerability scanning or SBOM generation

### Target State Benefits
- **Build Time**: Reduced to 15-25 minutes through intelligent caching

- **Resource Efficiency**: 60% reduction in compute usage through optimized job scheduling

- **Unified Configuration**: Single Conan-based approach across all platforms

- **Dependency Security**: Complete dependency tracking and vulnerability management

- **Enhanced Observability**: Detailed build analytics and performance metrics
