# Package Upload Setup Guide

This document explains how to configure package artifact uploads to multiple registries (Artifactory, GitHub Packages, Conan Center) for the OpenSSL project.

## Overview

The OpenSSL project now supports automatic package uploads to multiple registries:

- **Artifactory**: Primary package registry for OpenSSL packages
- **GitHub Packages**: GitHub's package registry
- **Conan Center**: Public package registry (optional)

## Configuration

### 1. Required Secrets

Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

#### Artifactory Secrets
- `ARTIFACTORY_URL`: Base URL of your Artifactory instance
  - Example: `https://your-company.jfrog.io`
- `ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME`: Username for Artifactory authentication
- `ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD`: Password or API key for Artifactory authentication

#### GitHub Packages (Automatic)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- `GITHUB_ACTOR`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

#### Conan Center (Optional)
- `CONAN_CENTER_USERNAME`: Username for Conan Center
- `CONAN_CENTER_PASSWORD`: Password for Conan Center

### 2. How to Configure Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add each secret with the appropriate value

## Workflows

### 1. Package Artifacts Upload Workflow

The main workflow for package uploads is `.github/workflows/package-artifacts-upload.yml`:

- **Triggers**: Push to main/release branches, manual dispatch
- **Features**: 
  - Multi-platform builds (Linux, Windows, macOS)
  - Upload to multiple registries
  - Automatic GitHub releases
  - Artifact retention

### 2. Updated Conan CI Workflow

The existing `.github/workflows/conan-ci.yml` has been updated to include:

- Package upload to Artifactory (if configured)
- Package upload to GitHub Packages (on main branch)
- Enhanced artifact uploads with retention

## Usage

### Manual Upload

To manually upload packages:

```bash
# Using the package registry manager
python scripts/conan/package-registry-manager.py \
  --package-ref "openssl/4.0.0@openssl/stable" \
  --registries artifactory github-packages
```

### Automatic Upload

Packages are automatically uploaded when:

1. Pushing to main branch (uploads to GitHub Packages)
2. Pushing to release branches (uploads to all configured registries)
3. Manual workflow dispatch

## Installation Instructions

### From Artifactory

```bash
# Add Artifactory remote
conan remote add artifactory https://your-artifactory.com/conan-local

# Authenticate
conan user -p <password> -r artifactory <username>

# Install OpenSSL package
conan install openssl/4.0.0@openssl/stable -r=artifactory
```

### From GitHub Packages

```bash
# Add GitHub Packages remote
conan remote add github-packages https://maven.pkg.github.com/openssl/openssl

# Authenticate
conan user -p <github_token> -r github-packages <username>

# Install OpenSSL package
conan install openssl/4.0.0@openssl/stable -r=github-packages
```

### From Conan Center

```bash
# Install OpenSSL package (no additional setup needed)
conan install openssl/4.0.0@openssl/stable
```

## Monitoring

### Upload Status

Check the workflow runs in the "Actions" tab to monitor upload status:

- Green checkmark: Upload successful
- Red X: Upload failed
- Yellow circle: Upload in progress

### Package Availability

Verify packages are available in registries:

```bash
# List packages in Artifactory
conan list "*" -r artifactory

# List packages in GitHub Packages
conan list "*" -r github-packages

# List packages in Conan Center
conan list "*" -r conancenter
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Upload fails with authentication error**
   - Check that secrets are properly configured
   - Verify credentials are correct
   - Ensure the user has upload permissions

2. **Package not found after upload**
   - Wait a few minutes for registry synchronization
   - Check the correct registry is being used
   - Verify the package reference is correct

3. **Workflow fails to trigger**
   - Check that the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
   - Verify the trigger conditions are met
   - Check for syntax errors in the workflow file

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test package upload functionality
python scripts/test-package-upload.py

# Check Conan configuration
conan config list

# List configured remotes
conan remote list

# Test registry connectivity
conan search "*" -r <registry-name>
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Secrets Management**
   - Never commit secrets to the repository
   - Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information
   - Rotate credentials regularly

2. **Package Signing**
   - Consider enabling package signing for production
   - Verify package integrity before installation
   - Use checksums for package validation

3. **Access Control**
   - Limit upload permissions to trusted users
   - Use separate credentials for different environments
   - Monitor upload activities

## Best Practices

1. **Version Management**
   - Use semantic versioning for packages
   - Tag releases appropriately
   - Maintain backward compatibility

2. **Registry Management**
   - Use multiple registries for redundancy
   - Implement proper retention policies
   - Monitor registry health

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep installation instructions up to date
   - Document any breaking changes
   - Provide migration guides
