# OpenSSL Tools Repository

This repository contains the build orchestration, advanced tooling, and automation scripts for OpenSSL development. It works in conjunction with the main OpenSSL repository to provide comprehensive CI/CD, build matrix management, performance optimization, and metrics collection.

## Key Features

### Build Orchestration
- **Intelligent Build Matrix**: Automatically generates build configurations based on changes
- **Dependency Management**: Handles complex dependency resolution and caching
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Coordinates builds across Linux, Windows, macOS
- **Performance Optimization**: Implements advanced caching and parallelization

### Metrics and Monitoring
- **Build Performance Tracking**: Collects and analyzes build times, cache hit rates
- **Status Reporting**: Provides comprehensive status updates to source repository
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Runs performance tests and tracks regressions
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitors CPU, memory, and disk usage during builds

### Warm-up and Optimization
- **Cache Warming**: Pre-populates caches for faster builds
- **Environment Preparation**: Sets up optimal build environments
- **Dependency Preloading**: Downloads and prepares dependencies in advance
- **Build Artifact Management**: Manages lifecycle of build artifacts

## Integration with OpenSSL Repository

The OpenSSL repository triggers builds in this repository using GitHub's repository dispatch mechanism:

1. **Trigger**: OpenSSL repository detects changes and sends dispatch event
2. **Analysis**: This repository analyzes changes and generates appropriate build matrix
3. **Execution**: Builds are executed across multiple platforms and configurations
4. **Reporting**: Results are reported back to the OpenSSL repository

## Usage

### For OpenSSL Developers
The integration is automatic - when you create a PR or push to the OpenSSL repository, this repository will automatically:
- Analyze your changes
- Generate appropriate build matrix
- Execute builds and tests
- Report results back to your PR

### For Build Engineers
This repository provides tools for:
- Customizing build matrices
- Adding new platforms or configurations
- Optimizing build performance
- Monitoring build health

## Configuration

### Build Matrix Configuration
Edit `configs/ci-matrix.yml` to customize build configurations:

```yaml
platforms:
  linux:
    - ubuntu-20.04
    - ubuntu-22.04
  windows:
    - windows-2019
    - windows-2022
  macos:
    - macos-11
    - macos-12

profiles:
  - default
  - fips
  - debug
  - sanitizers
```

### Performance Optimization
Configure caching and optimization in `configs/cache-optimization.yml`:

```yaml
cache:
  conan_cache_size: "10GB"
  compiler_cache_size: "5GB"
  warm_up_frequency: "daily"

optimization:
  parallel_jobs: "auto"
  memory_limit: "8GB"
  timeout: "2h"
```
